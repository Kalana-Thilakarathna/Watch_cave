# Watch Cave

## Introduction & Objective

We are a team of five students who are passionate about web development and movie streaming. We have created a web application called **Watch Cave** that allows users to watch movies online for free. Our objective was to provide a user-friendly, accessible, and secure platform for movie lovers.

## What We Have Accomplished

We have successfully implemented the following features for our web application:

- **Home Page**: This is the landing page of our web application. It displays the latest and popular movies, as well as a search bar and a navigation menu.
- **Movie Page**: This is the page where users can watch a movie of their choice. It displays the movie title, poster, synopsis, rating, genre, and cast. It also has a video player, a comment section, and a button to add the movie to the watch list.
- **Categories Page**: This is the page where users can browse movies by different categories, such as genre, year, country, and language.
- **User Registration**: This is the page where users can create an account or log in to our web application. It requires users to provide their email, password, username, and profile picture.
- **Watch List**: This is the page where users can see the movies that they have added to their watch list. They can also remove movies from their watch list or mark them as watched.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: This is the feature that allows users to rate and review the movies that they have watched. They can also see the ratings and reviews of other users.
- **User Profile**: This is the page where users can see and edit their personal information, such as email, password, username, and profile picture. They can also see their watch history and ratings and reviews.
- **Responsive Design**: This is the feature that ensures that our web application adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Services

We have provided the following services for our web application:

- **Security**: We have implemented a password mechanism to protect our web application from unauthorized access. However, we did not implement encryption for this project.
- **Accessibility**: We have used semantic HTML, alt text, contrast ratio, and keyboard navigation to make our web application accessible to people with disabilities.
- **User Friendly**: We have used intuitive design, clear navigation, consistent layout, and helpful feedback to make our web application easy to use and understand.

## Technologies We Have Used

We have used the following technologies for our web application:

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and React
- **Back-End**: Node.js (Express), MongoDB
